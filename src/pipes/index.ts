/**
 * A library of pipes for Brick Next.
 *
 * @remarks
 *
 * Usage in Typescript:
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { pipes } from "@easyops-cn/brick-next-pipes";
 *
 * const stringified = pipes.yamlStringify(yourObject);
 * ```
 *
 * Usage in Brick Next Evaluations:
 *
 * ```
 * <% yourObject |> PIPES.yamlStringify %>
 * or
 * <% PIPES.yamlStringify(yourObject) %>
 * ```
 *
 * It also transparently exports these functions from lodash:
 *
 * {@link https://lodash.com/docs/#countBy | countBy}
 *
 * equal (from {@link https://lodash.com/docs/#isEqual | _.isEqual})
 *
 * {@link https://lodash.com/docs/#find | find}
 *
 * {@link https://lodash.com/docs/#findIndex | findIndex}
 *
 * {@link https://lodash.com/docs/#findLast | findLast}
 *
 * {@link https://lodash.com/docs/#findLastIndex | findLastIndex}
 *
 * {@link https://lodash.com/docs/#get | get}
 *
 * {@link https://lodash.com/docs/#groupBy | groupBy}
 *
 * {@link https://lodash.com/docs/#keyBy | keyBy}
 *
 * {@link https://lodash.com/docs/#uniq | uniq}
 *
 *{@link https://lodash.com/docs/#round | round}
